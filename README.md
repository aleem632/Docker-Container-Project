### STATISTICS

![Container](https://github.com/aleem632/docker/blob/03ce80a6b5ac0400fcc7d5cba940b22a32d43178/Diagram/Container.png)

###### SCENARIO
- Running on VMS
- Rugular deployment
- Continous changed


### PROBLEMS
- high CapEx & OpEx
- human Error in deployment
- Not compatible with microservice architecture
- Resource Wastage
- Not portable, Env not in syncs

### SOLUTION
- Containers
- Comsumes low Resource
- Suits very well for microservice design

### BENEFITS
- Deployment via images 
- same container images across enviroment
- Reusable & Repeatable 

### FLOW OF EXECUTION

![DOCKER COMPOSE](https://github.com/aleem632/docker/blob/9c89a5adfd039d2881912037645af7bf89d59ee9/Diagram/Docker-Compose.png)


### STEPS

- Steps to setup our stack services
- Find right base image from dockerhub
- write Dockerfile to customize images
- Write docker-compose.yml file to run multi containers
- Test it & Host Images on Dockerhub
